Ben, your assessment on the root cause?\n\n**Ben:**  It was a cascading failure. The initial database overload on Orion triggered a chain reaction, ultimately taking down Quantum Platform's API dependency for a short while.  We need better resource allocation for Orion.\n\n**Chloe:** Agreed.  This highlights the interdependencies we've discussed.  The Quantum Platform's recovery was swift, thankfully, but the Nova Analytics impact on client reporting is concerning. We need a more robust monitoring system across all three projects.\n\n**Alex:** I've drafted a proposal for improved resource allocation and automated failover for Orion.
